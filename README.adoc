A simple inventory and shopping cart system, written using Python 3.6 and Django.

== Usage

See tests.py for more examples.

Products are implemented as Django models in the inventory app. They have:
    
    * title
    * price
    * inventory_count

Cart and ProductSearch provide APIs to this model.

=== Search

The ProductSearch class implements a filter-based search functionality. 
One can search for products by:
    
    * available quantity
    * all or part of the title (case-insenstive)
    * price range

A search is completed by calling the ProductSearch.query() method, 
which will return a list of all matching products.

Examples:
[source, python]
----
>>> from inventory.models import Product
>>> from inventory.search import ProductSearch
>>> search = ProductSearch(title="car")
>>> print(search.query())
    ['Car, Used', 'Car, New']
>>> search.price_range = (10000, 20000)
>>> print(search.query())
    ['Car, Used']
----

To see the enitre inventory, construct an empty ProductSearch. 
To filter out products with no stock, set min_qty to 1.

[source, python]
----
>>> search = ProductSearch()
>>> entire_inventory = search.query()
>>> search.min_qty = 1
>>> only_available = search.query()
----

[source, python]
----
>>> search = ProductSearch(title="widget", min_qty = 0, price_range = (0, 100))
>>> print(search.query())
    ['sold_out_widget', 'new_widget']
>>> search.min_qty = 1
>>> print(search.query())
    ['new_widget']
----

=== Cart

The Cart class implements a shopping cart. It 

Products are added and removed with the add_product, remove_product  
methods, which accept a Product and quantity (optional) and return 
the new in-cart quantity of the given product.

[source, python]
----
>>> from cart.cart import Cart
>>> cart = Cart()
>>> water = ProductSearch(title='water').query()[0]
>>> print(cart.add_product(water))
    1
>>> print(cart.add_product(water, 10))
    11
>>> print(cart.remove_product(water))
    10
>>> print(cart.product_quantity(water))
    10
----

Calling remove_product with a quantity greater than what
is already in the cart will remove the product:

[source, python]
----
>>> cart.add_product(water, 5)
>>> print(cart.remove_product(water, 8))
    0
>>> print(cart.contains_product(water))
    False
----

Analagously, calling add_product with a quantity greater 
than the available inventory for a product will increase
add the maximum available amount to the cart:

[source, python]
----
>>> print(water.inventory_count)
    5
>>> print(cart.add_product(water, 10))
    5
----

The validate method checks each entry in the cart
and verifies whether they are available in
the requested quantities. It returns a list
of all Products that are not.

[source, python]
----
>>> cart.add_product(water, 5)
>>> print(cart.validate())
    []
----

The complete method checks if the cart is valid,
and deducts each item from inventory only if
the cart is valid.

[source, python]
----
>>> cart.add_product(water, 5)
>>> print(cart.complete)
    True
----

A cart may become invalid if another cart is completed before it:

[source, python]
----
>>> print(water.inventory_count)
    5
>>> cart1.add_product(water, 5)
>>> cart2.add_product(water. 5)
>>> print((cart1.validate, cart2.validate))
    [], []
>>> print(cart1.complete)
    True
>>> print(cart2.validate)
    [Water]
----
